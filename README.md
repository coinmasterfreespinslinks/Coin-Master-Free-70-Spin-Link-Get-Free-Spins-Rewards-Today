Attacks can help you take down other playersâ€™ villages and steal coins. However, make sure to use attacks strategically. Attacking players who have a lot of coins or valuable cards can help you maximize your returns.

#### **4. Donâ€™t Waste Spins**

While itâ€™s tempting to spin the wheel every chance you get, make sure to save your spins for times when theyâ€™ll benefit you most. For example, if thereâ€™s an event running, save your spins to take full advantage of the rewards.
